# fullstack-odyssey
A curated collection of my full-stack development projects — from foundational HTML/CSS to advanced React, Node.js, and beyond. This repo documents my learning journey, growth, and real-world builds.

# 🚀 Fullstack Odyssey

Welcome to my **Fullstack Odyssey** — a personal journey through the world of web development. From the first lines of HTML to building dynamic, full-stack applications with React, Node.js, and databases, this repository documents my evolution as a developer.

### 🌱 Why this repo?
As I learn and grow, I’m building real projects to reinforce concepts and apply skills. Projects are grouped by level:
- 🟢 Beginner – HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript
- 🟡 Intermediate – DOM manipulation, APIs, simple backends
- 🔴 Advanced – Full-stack apps, authentication, deployment

### 📁 Project Structure

- ### Beginner-Projects/
    - #### 1. TinDog/
        - A responsive front-end project demonstrating HTML and CSS skills, mimicking a landing page for a dog dating app.
    - #### 2. Dice-Game/
        - A simple interactive game built with JavaScript. It displays two dice, and upon every page refresh, both dice roll to show a random number, with the higher number determining the winner.
    - #### 3. Drum Kit/
        -  A fun and interactive website built using basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can play drum sounds by either clicking on on-screen images or pressing the corresponding keyboard keys shown on each image. This project demonstrates event handling and DOM manipulation fundamentals.
    - #### 3. QR Code Generator/
        - This simple CLI app generates a QR code for a user-provided URL and stores it as a PNG image using the qr-image package. It accepts a URL and a masked password via the terminal using inquirer, generates a qr_image.png of the entered URL, and saves the URL and password to a text file named url.txt for reference.
          
- ### Intermediate-Projects/
    - #### 1. Simon Game/
        - Developed a fully functional Simon game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. This project was an excellent opportunity to solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design principles.
        
    - #### 2. Band-Generator/
        - A fun web app that randomly generates quirky and cool band names with the click of a button. Built using Node.js, Express, and EJS, this project demonstrates core fullstack skills like routing, templating, static assets, and form handling.
          
    - #### 3. Secret Access App/
        - A basic full-stack Express app that simulates password-based access to a secret page. Demonstrates backend routing, form handling, and conditional rendering using Node.js and Express.
     
    - #### 4. JSON-File-Handler (Taco Town)/
        - A simple Node.js and Express project that demonstrates how to work with JSON file using `JSON.parse()`. It teaches basic data parsing, routing, and rendering JSON data in views.
     
    - #### 5. REST-API-CRUD-App/
        - A full-stack Node.js and Express app that interacts with a REST API using all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). Demonstrates use of Bearer token authentication, form handling, and dynamic response rendering with EJS.
    - #### 6. Lisper/
        - Lisper is a simple Whisper-style web app built with Node.js and Express. It fetches and displays anonymous secrets from an external API using EJS for dynamic rendering. A fun way to explore API integration and server-side rendering.
     
    - #### 7. Weather App/
        - A Node.js/Express app that fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and displays it with EJS. Demonstrates API integration, server-side rendering, and error handling in a clean interface.
Stack: Express, EJS, Axios, OpenWeatherMap API
