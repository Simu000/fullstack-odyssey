    <ul>
      <li>When making chocolate desserts, always add a little salt. It makes the chocolate flavour more intense.</li>
      <li>Whenever you travel abroad bring a new soundtrack for each place you visit, preferably one you have never
        heard before. In the future, every time you listen to each soundtrack again they will bring you vivid memories
        of the places you have visited.</li>
      <li>Do not try to be the person your parents would want you to be. Be the person you would like your child to be.
        It more clearly defines your own convictions, desires, goals, and motivates you to be your best.</li>
      <li>If a friend or a family member gets diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer’s, in the early stages try to find
        out what their favorite songs of all time are. This way you can create a playlist that may benefit them in later
        stages of the disease.</li>
      <li>When a friend is upset, ask them one simple question before saying anything else: 'Do you want to talk about
        it or do you want to be distracted from it?'</li>
      <li>If you ever forget your WiFi password or want to get your school WiFi password, type this into a connected
        computer’s command line: <code>netsh wlan show profile WiFi-name key=clear</code></li>
